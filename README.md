# Electromagnetism COMSOL Projects (Fall 2022)

This repository contains COMSOL simulation projects completed as part of the **Electromagnetism** course during **Fall 2022**. The repository includes both the **main project** and **mini projects**, which involve the simulation of electrostatic and electromagnetic systems. These projects aim to analyze various configurations of capacitors, electric fields, and the effect of dielectric materials, using COMSOL Multiphysics.

Each project is structured into folders containing documentation, reports, and simulation files for easy access and organization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into **Main Project** and **Mini Projects**, with each containing three primary subfolders:

### 1. **Documentation Folder**
- Contains **Word documents** with detailed explanations of the projects, including problem statements and reports.
- Reports and the theoretical background of the simulations are stored here.

### 2. **Report Folder**
- Contains the **PDF reports** for each project. These reports summarize the simulation setup, methodology, and results.

### 3. **Simulations Folder**
- Contains the **COMSOL simulation files** (`.mph`), which are the model files used to run the simulations.

## Projects Overview

- **Electrostatic Simulations**: Simulations of electrostatic fields within various capacitor configurations. Includes the analysis of electric potential and field distribution.

- **Capacitor Analysis**: Projects focused on calculating capacitance, electric displacement, and analyzing the impact of different parameters on capacitor behavior.

- **Dielectric Materials**: Simulations examining the effects of dielectric materials, such as mica, on electric fields and capacitance.

## Getting Started

To run these simulations, you'll need to have **COMSOL Multiphysics** installed on your machine. If you don't have COMSOL, you can download a trial version from the [COMSOL website](https://www.comsol.com/).

### Steps to Run the Simulations

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrmidaHnd/Electromagnetism_COMSOL_Projects_Fall2022.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the relevant folder within either the **Main Project** or **Mini Projects**.

3. Open the `.mph` COMSOL model files using **COMSOL Multiphysics**.

4. Follow the specific instructions in each folder to set up and run the simulations.
